> [SHA-1] : Generates 40 digits hexadecimal code of password.

*When you make a password for any account, it doesn't save your password

*It changes your password in such a way that even you can't recognise your password.

*Applications mordenize your password to a new form using the fixed algorithm and save that.

*There are so many algorithms which fullfill these need.
[for eg., SHA-0, SHA-1, SHA-2, SHA-3, SHA-256, SHA-512, MD4, MD5, RipeMD-150, RipeMD-256, CRC32, etc.]

*These algorithms are one directional, which means you can't generate password from fraom the hash.

*So, when you log-in to your account, and write the password, the application make the hash using fixed algorithm and matchs to 
      the saved hash. If it matches correctly then only you got enter into your account.

- So here you can see the working of SHA-1.
